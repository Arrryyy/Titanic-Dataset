# **Project Name: Titanic Dataset Recommendation System**

The Titanic Dataset Recommendation System predicts passenger survival likelihood using RandomForestClassifier. It allocates emergency resources based on predicted probabilities, offering insights into resource allocation strategies.

**Description:**
This project implements a recommendation system based on the Titanic dataset. Using RandomForestClassifier, it predicts passenger survival likelihood and allocates emergency resources accordingly. The system offers insights into resource allocation strategies for emergency situations.

**Features:**
- Predicts passenger survival likelihood
- Allocates emergency resources based on predicted probabilities
- Offers insights into resource allocation strategies

**Installation:**
1. Clone the repository.
2. Install the required dependencies: pandas, scikit-learn.
3. Run the main script to execute the recommendation system.

**Usage:**
1. Load the Titanic dataset.
2. Preprocess the data by handling missing values and encoding categorical features.
3. Train the RandomForestClassifier model on the preprocessed data.
4. Provide sample passenger data to predict survival likelihood and allocate emergency resources.
